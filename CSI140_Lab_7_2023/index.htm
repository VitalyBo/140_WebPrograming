                <h2>History of Ford F-150</h2>
                <p>The Ford F-150 was first introduced in 1975 and has since become a staple in the truck industry. It has seen numerous redesigns and improvements over the years, making it one of the most popular trucks on the market.
				The new generation F-150 was introduced for the 2009 model year. These trucks differ in grill and headlight styling from the Super Duty; standard cab models again have two doors instead of four.
				The entire engine lineup for the F-150 (excluding the SVT Raptor) has been updated for the 2011 model year. Along with two new V8s, the F-150 gets a new 3.7L V6 engine and a powerful 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 dubbed EcoBoost. An automatic transmission is the only option.</p>
